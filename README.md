# Bitmap Parser App

A typescript implementation of Bitmap Parser, and visualiser for Bitmap in HTML5 Canvas.

## Why?

Why not. This is a bitmap parser written in Typescript for me to understand how Bitmaps and basically how digital image files work, how they're compressed, uncompressed, stored, encoded, decoded, parsed, etc.

## Getting Started

Setup

1. Clone repo
1. `npm install`
1. Run dev server `npm run dev`
